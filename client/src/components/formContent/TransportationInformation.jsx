            <li>Students who are open enrolled or who live within a non-transport zone are not eligible for transportation and will not be issued a bus pass.</li>
            <li>Students must use their assigned bus route and bus stops.</li>
            <li>Students are required to scan their SMART tag bus pass on and off the bus each time they ride.</li>
            <li>DO NOT PHYSICALLY ALTER BUS PASS. You can place the pass in a clear plastic sleeve attached to a lanyard if needed. If a card is damaged or lost, a replacement bus pass can be requested through <a href="https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/DialogueCustom.aspx?k=WK3Z6DLT@DG2T5DLT" rel="noreferer" target="_blank">Let's Talk</a>.</li>
            <li>Only students that are eligible for transportation can ride the bus. We are unable to accommodate one day bus passes for students to ride home with other students on the bus.</li>
            <li>Students who receive specialized transportation services do not need to request a SMART tag bus pass. Your student's card will be distributed to their bus driver directly.</li>
            <li>Bus passes for general education students will be distributed to students by their bus driver after an application has been submitted. Students may ride in the interim while waiting for their bus pass.</li>
            <li>If you would like additional information on SMART tag or have any other transportation-related questions, please submit through <a href="https://www.k12insight.com/Lets-Talk/DialogueCustom.aspx?k=WK3Z6DLT@DG2T5DLT" rel="noreferer" target="_blank">Let's Talk</a>.</li>
